v1.1.0 (2015-11-05) 
RELEASE: Currently scrapes <artist>, <album>, <studio> (taken from Label), <title>, <runtime>, <year>, <plot>, <country> and<thumb URL>(displays album cover-front).

Artist description and Recording description are stored/displayed as <plot>.  Artist and Recording descriptions are from Wiki(proper credit given to Wiki in displayed description).
  Artist description is default and will display for most recordings(tracks).  Recording(track) description, if found at Wiki, will replace Artist description.  Wiki has recording(track) information for about 40-50% of tracks I have scraped.  Your results will most likely be different as available information typically depends on artist and song popularity.

<country>, although scraped, is not displayed.  Kodi musicvideo database does not support this tag at this time.

Fanart is not scraped as Kodi musicvideo database does not support this tag at this time.

<track> is not scraped as track number/position is not relevant.
